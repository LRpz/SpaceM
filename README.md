# SpaceM -  method for single-cell metabolomics

SpaceM integrates microscopy data with MALDI-imaging microscopy to enable 
high precision estimation of which cells have been sampled. \
This repository contains the source code for the paper SpaceM method for 
single-cell metabolomics characterizes metabolic heterogeneity states.

### Installation

We support `python3`. To install the dependencies run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Download and install [CellProfiler 3.0.0](https://cellprofiler.org/previous_releases/)
Download and install [Fiji release of December 22 2015](https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads)

In `paths.json` add the path of CellProfiler to `"CellProfiler path"` and the path of Fiji to `"Fiji path"`

### Data requirement

The Main Folder `MF` for SpaceM analysis is created manually and should be organized as follow: 

```
MF
|
└─ Input
    |
    └─ MALDI
    |    *.RAW
    |    *.UDP
    |    *.imzML
    |    *.ibd
    |        
    └─ Microscopy
         |
         └─ preMALDI
         |    tile_1.tif
         |    tile_2.tif
         |    ...
         |    out.txt
         |   
         |
         └─ postMALDI
              tile_1.tif
              tile_2.tif
              ...
              out.txt
```


#### MALDI-imaging

The `.RAW`, `.UDP`, `.imzML` and `.ibd` files are required. The data should be uploaded and analyzed in [METASPACE]( https://metaspace2020.eu/)
It is imperative that ablation marks are visible and non-overlapping in the post-MALDI microsocpy. For more details, see the Methods section in the paper.

#### Microscopy

For both pre- and post-MALDI images, a tiled acquisition of the cell culture area with black penmarks are required. 
The individual tiles should be stored with a text file `out.txt` containing the upper left pixel x-y coordinates in um of each tile. 
At the moment, SpaceM does the stitching and is optimized for the Nikon Ti-E instrument output format. 
Soon SpaceM will be updated to only accept pre-stitched images, thus removing the requirement for Nikon instrument. 

Once complete, add the path of the Main folder `MF` to the `"MF"` entry in the `path.json` file.

A working CellProfiler (CP) pipeline and project files able to segment the cells are required. 
Both the path of the CP pipeline and project should be added to the `"CellProfiler pipeline path"` and 
`"CellProfiler project path"` in `paths.json`, respectively.

### Execute SpaceM

Run `python runAnalysis.py` and follow instructions when prompted. 
During analysis the Main folder will be added an `Analysis` sub-folder containing the results. 
The final spatio-molecular matrix will be stored as `MORPHnMOL.csv` and can be found at 

```
MF
|
└─ Analysis
    |
    └─ scAnalysis
    |    MORPHnMOL.csv
    
    ...
```


The SpaceM datasets presented in the paper are available on [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS78/descriptors).

All analysis used to generate the results present in this manuscript from the spatio-molecular matrices generated by SpaceM on [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SPS8qnvUXSxsAC6wRDPgDzImdKi256S5?usp=sharing).
